 2. Specify the Subversion repository URL containing Simulink models which will be considered by the OSLC Simulink adapter in the config.properties file under edu.gatech.mbsec.adapter.simulink/configuration. As an example displayed below, the Subversion repository URL  is specified to be 
 ```text
https://mysvnrepos.com/svn/simulinkrepository
```
Warning: Do not put quotes around the file path!
 3. Set the time period in seconds at which the adapter will poll the Subversion repository for updates. Example:  
 ```text
delayInSecondsBetweenDataRefresh = none
``` 
or
 ```text
delayInSecondsBetweenDataRefresh = 90
```
 4. Specify your Subversion credentials through the svnUserName and svnPassword fields
 5. Specify the location of the folder containing Simulink models where the Subversion files will be saved locally in config.properties file under edu.gatech.mbsec.adapter.simulink/configuration. As an example displayed below, the location of the folder containing Simulink models for the OSLC adapter is specified to 
 ```text
C:/Users/…/git/oslc4jsimulink/edu.gatech.mbsec.adapter.simulink/localworkingdirs
```

#### c.	Retrieval of Simulink models from individual Subversion-hosted files - “Individual SVN files mode”

1. Set the value of useIndividualSubversionFiles to true
2.	Specify the Subversion file URLs representing Simulink models which will be published by the adapter at startup in the subversionfiles.csv file under edu.gatech.mbsec.adapter.simulink/configuration. As an example displayed below, the Subversion file URLs  are specified to be
 ```text
https://koneksys1:18080/svn/repository1/model11.slx
https://koneksys1:18080/svn/repository1/model4.slx
``` 
3.	During adapter runtime, you can change the Subversion files to be published through the web app at [http://localhost:8080/oslc4jsimulink/services/svnfilepublisher](http://localhost:8080/oslc4jsimulink/services/svnfilepublisher)

4.	Specify your Subversion credentials through the svnUserName and svnPassword fields
5.	Specify the location of the folder containing Simulink models where the Subversion files will be saved locally in config.properties file under edu.gatech.mbsec.adapter.simulink/configuration. As an example displayed below, the location of the folder containing Simulink models for the OSLC adapter is specified to 
 ```text
C:/Users/…/git/oslc4jsimulink/edu.gatech.mbsec.adapter.simulink/localworkingdirs
``` 
Note: The contents of this folder will be deleted when the adapter starts in individualSubversionFile mode.  
Warning: Do not choose as local Subversion file storage the same folder as the one containing all sample Simulink models, nor the one containing the local Simulink models models without Subversion info.  
 

### 8.	Setting up the Matlab workspace
1.	Launch Matlab 
2.	From the File menu, select Set Path…(if your Matlab version has a ribbon-based user interface such as inR2013, choose Set Path in the Home ribbon in the Environment section)
3.	Use the **Add Folder…** command to add the matlab folder of the oslc4jsimulink project to the Matlab search path based on the location of your local git repository
4. Use the **Add with Subfolders…** command to add the folder in the oslc4jsimulink project containing Simulink models, or local working copies of Subversion files, to the Matlab search path. For example, based on the settings in Step #5, the concerned folder would have as path in “local mode”  
 ```text
C:/Users/…/git/oslc4jsimulink/edu.gatech.mbsec.adapter.simulink/Simulink Models/
```
  and in “SVN repository mode” and “Individual SVN files mode”:
  ```text
  C:/Users/…/git/oslc4jsimulink/edu.gatech.mbsec.adapter.simulink/localworkingdirs
 ```
5.	Click Save and then Close
 

### 9. Installing Apache Tomcat

*Optional: This step is only necessary if you want to use a specific Tomcat instance instead of the Tomcat instance embedded in Eclipse and downloaded by the Maven Tomcat plugin. This step is only necessary if you want:*
- *to deploy the Simulink adapter on a specific Tomcat instance (possibly with specific configurations)*
- *to deploy the Simulink adapter such that it accepts HTTP PUT requests, necessary for updating Simulink parameters*

#### Configuring Apache Tomcat

1.	Download Tomcat 8 by going to this page:
https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi 
2.	Download the zip distribution for your operating system. Note: do not use the windows installer as it doesn’t install all Tomcat scripts. 
3.	Unzip the Tomcat 8 distribution in a folder where your user account has read/write permission. Note: Windows disables direct file access to programs folder for normal users per default. 
4.	Make sure that the /bin folder in your Tomcat installation directory contains the catalina.bat batch file 
5.	Make sure that you have JDK 8 installed on your machine. OSLC Adapters are now currently being build with Java 8 compilers. So Tomcat should also run with Java 8. 
6.	On Windows, verify your installed Java version by typing in the command prompt java –version
7.	Test that environment variables **JAVA_HOME** and **PATH** respectively point to JDK and JDK/bin. Verify this on Windows by typing in the command prompt echo %JAVA_HOME% and echo %PATH%. If necessary set the envornoment variable in the command prompt using the set command (Example: set variable=string). After having set the environment variables, open a  new ommand prompt to verify the values of the environment variables.
8.	Make sure that JAVA_HOME and JRE_HOME both point to the same Java version, for example Java 8. 
9.	Make sure that CATALINA_HOME points to the correct installation directory of your Tomcat distribution. 
10.	Adding Server Runtime Environment in Eclipse
11.	In Eclipse. Open Window -> Preferences -> Server -> Runtime Environments to create a Tomcat installed runtime.
12.	Click on Add... to open the New Server Runtime dialog, 
13.	From the drop down menu, select Tomcat 8.0 as shown below. Click Next.
14.	Enter the Tomcat 8.0 installation directory (not the Apache installation directory!) as highlighted below.
15.	Click on Finish.

#### Enabling PUT on Apache Tomcat

Tomcat by default is not enabled for HTTP PUT command. But, it can easily be configured to support it.
1.	In your Apache Tomcat 8 installation directory, open /conf/web.xml
2.	Add the readonly init param to the web.xml file as shown below and save the file
 ```text
        <init-param>
            		<param-name>readonly</param-name>
            		<param-value>false</param-value>
        </init-param>
```
Note: If you get the warning shown below while trying to save the file, then copy the web.xml file into another location, modify it, and then replace the original web.xml file by the modified web.xml file.
 

#### Setting the Apache Tomcat server port 

1.	By default, the OSLC Simulink adapter service will run on port 8181. Change the port of the oslc4jsimulink service only if you need to avoid a conflict with another service already running on port 8181. Skip the next steps if you do not need to change the port. 
2.	In Eclipse, open the Project Explorer view. (Window → Show View → Project Explorer)
3.	Expand the edu.gatech.mbsec.adapter.simulink project
4.	Select and open the maven pom.xml file through double-click
5.	The pom.xml file contains several tabs. By default, the overview tab will be displayed. The various available tabs are displayed at the bottom of the editor window. Click on the pom.xml tab of the pom.xml.
6.	In the pom.xml tab of the pom.xml file, specify the port of the OSLC Simulink adapter service in the Maven tomcat plugin configuration found at the bottom of the pom.xml tab of the pom.xml file. Enter the port number in the configuration section.

####	Configuring Tomcat user roles and passwords (only useful for deploying adapter as war on standalone Tomcat)

In the /conf folder of the Tomcat installation directory, add in tomcat-users.xml inside the <tomcat-users> tag the following user tag
```xml
 <user username="admin" password="admin" roles="admin-gui,manager-gui,manager-script" />
```
Note: Manager-script role is necessary to enable Maven deploy 
  
####	Copying adapter configuration properties (only useful for deploying adapter as war on standalone Tomcat)
1.	In Eclipse, open the Project Explorer view. (Window → Show View → Project Explorer)
2.	Expand the edu.gatech.mbsec.adapter.simulink project
3.	Copy the folder named oslc4jsimulink configuration
4.	Paste the folder in the Tomcat installation directory (Example: C:\Program Files\apache-tomcat-8.0.24-windows-x64\apache-tomcat-8.0.24/oslc4jsimulink  configuration)

####	Maven configuration properties (only useful for deploying adapter as war on standalone Tomcat) 

In the maven user/.m2/ (Example: C:\Users\Axel\.m2) folder, add in settings.xml the following
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings>
	<servers>
		<server>
		<id>tomcat7</id>
		<username>admin</username>
		<password>admin</password>
		</server>
	</servers>
</settings>
```
Note: you can still use Tomcat 8 with the Tomcat 7 Maven plugin even though it only officially supports Tomcat 7. There is no Tomcat Maven plugin for Tomcat 8 at this point. 


### 10.	Installing the Chrome/Firefox Postman plugin (or any REST client)

*Optional - only useful if you want to use this REST client*

1.	*For Google Chrome, add the [Postman REST client](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm?hl=en) to your browser* 
2.	*And the [Postman launcher](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-launcher/igofndmniooofoabmmpfonmdnhgchoka?hl=en)*


### 11.	Launching the OSLC Simulink Adapter

There are several options

1. Deploying OSLC Simulink adapter on Tomcat server embedded in Eclipse launched through Maven
2. Deploying OSLC Simulink adapter on standalone Tomcat server manually
3. Deploying OSLC Simulink adapter on standalone Tomcat server automatically from Eclipse
4. Deploying OSLC Simulink adapter on standalone Tomcat server automatically from Eclipse in debug mode

##### *Optional: Launching Tomcat server manually*
*For options except 2) and 3), you need to launch the Tomcat server manually*

1. *Open a command prompt*
2. *Change the directory of the command prompt to the/bin folder of the Tomcat installation directory using the cd command (Example:  cd C:\Program Files\apache-tomcat-8.0.24-windows-x64\apache-tomcat-8.0.24\bin)*
3. Launch Tomcat by running the following command: **catalina start** 

*For all options except 1), if you wish to stop the Tomcat server*

1. *Open a command prompt*
2. *Change the directory of the command prompt to the/bin folder of the Tomcat installation directory using the cd command* 
3. *Stop Tomcat by running the following command: shutdown –force. Note: It is important to avoid a memory problem by using shutdown –force, else the OSLC Simulink adapter can cause a memory leak*


#### Option #1: Deploying OSLC Simulink adapter on Tomcat server embedded in Eclipse launched through Maven
Select the oslc4jsimulink launch configuration (Run -> Run Configurations… and select in the Maven build category the launch configuration named **oslc adapter for simulink** and click Run. In the console window, several logging related exceptions will appear (SLF4J and log4j). This is not critical.

Warning: If the OSLC Simulink adapter service fails to launch due to a java.net.BindException, a different port for the OSLC Simulink adapter needs to be used since there is a conflict with another service using the same port. By default, the OSLC Simulink adapter uses port 8181. A java.net.BindException means that a different service is already using this port. Go back to Steps #5 and #10 to change the port number.

Note: In order to stop a running oslc4jsimulink web application, click Terminate in the Console window, or in the toolbar of the debug perspective.

Note: If you launch the Maven launch configuration (OSLC Simulink adapter) in debug mode, and do not see the Java code when the application hits a breakpoint, then you need to add the Eclipse workspace to the source lookup path. In the Debug view, right click on the running thread (in threads tab), or on the application as shown below and select Edit Source Lookup, and add the workspace. Re-launch the Maven launch configuration and the code should be visible in the editor when the application hits a breakpoint. 



#### Option #2: Deploying OSLC Simulink adapter on standalone Tomcat server manually
1. Option 1)
	1. In Eclipse, open the Project Explorer view. (Window → Show View → Project Explorer)
	2. Expand the edu.gatech.mbsec.adapter.simulink project
	3. Open the /target folder 
	4. rename the oslc4jsimulink-1.1.0.war file into oslc4jsimulink.war 
	5. copy oslc4jsimulink.war into the /webapps folder of the of the Tomcat installation directory
2. Option 2)
	1. In your browser go to localhost:8080
	2. Click on Manager App
	3. If asked for your credentials, type in admin as user name and password
	4. In the Deploy section, select the WAR file to upload using the dialog shown below.

#### Option #3: Deploying OSLC Simulink adapter on standalone Tomcat server automatically from Eclipse
Run the Maven launch configuration named **oslc adapter for simulink tomcat deploy**

#### Option #4: Deploying OSLC Simulink adapter on standalone Tomcat server automatically from Eclipse in debug mode

1. In the startup.bat script under {TOMCAT_INSTALL_DIR}/bin, add following lines to the beginning as shown below 
```text
set JPDA_ADDRESS=8000
set JPDA_TRANSPORT=dt_socket
setlocal
```
2. Open a command prompt to launch the Tomcat server 
3. Change the directory of the command prompt to the/bin folder of the Tomcat installation directory using the cd command (Example:  cd C:\Program Files\apache-tomcat-8.0.24-windows-x64\apache-tomcat-8.0.24\bin)
4. Launch Tomcat by running the following command: **catalina jpda start**
5. Set breakpoints in your code if necessary
6. First launch the remote java application named **remote debugger oslc4jsimulink on tomcat** by choosing in Eclipse Debug-> Debug Configurations… , and then run the remote java application
7. And then run the Maven launch configuration named **oslc4jsimulink tomcat deploy debug**


### 12.	Testing the OSLC Simulink Adapter

#### Testing the retrieval of OSLC resources in HTML

1. Launch your web browser Google Chrome
2. In the URL field, type for test purposes: [http://localhost:8181/oslc4jsimulink/services/catalog/singleton](http://localhost:8181/oslc4jsimulink/services/catalog/singleton). This will send a HTTP GET request to retrieve the HTML representation of the Simulink Service Provider Catalog. This will launch a Matlab command window which will close automatically. The Matlab command window may display warnings if it is an older version than R2013b.
3. You will then see an HTML page showing you the list of Service Providers. You can browse from the Service Providers (e.g. for model11) to the Services and ultimately to the OSLC Simulink resources.


#### Testing the retrieval of OSLC resources in RDF

1. Click on the Postman icon at the top right of the Chrome browser . A new tab will open. 
2. In the URL field, type for test purposes the URI of a resource published by the Simulink adapter (Example: http://localhost:8181/oslc4jsimulink/services/model1/blocks/Constant). 
3. Click on the Headers field to the right of the URL field
4. Enter Accept in the Header field and application/rdf+xml in the value field as shown below
5. Click Send
6. This will send a HTTP GET request to retrieve the RDF/XML representation of the Simulink block.

The edu.gatech.mbsec.adapter.simulink project contains example Simulink models containing different types of Simulink elements. The example models are located in the folder [simulinkmodels](/org.eclipse.lyo.adapter.simulink/simulinkmodels). Model [model11](org.eclipse.lyo.adapter.simulink/simulinkmodels/model11.slx) contains blocks, subsystems, model reference blocks, ports, lines, and lines with multiple target ports
